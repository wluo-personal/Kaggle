Clearly you need to reread your own policies, from WP:Vandalism, vandalism is:
 Blanking
 Page lengtheningNPOV violations
 Spam 
 Vandalbots 
 Silly vandalism 
 Sneaky vandalism 
 Userspace vandalism 
 Image vandalism 
 Abuse of tags 
 Page move vandalism 
 Link vandalism
 Avoidant vandalism
 Modifying users' comments
 Discussion page vandalism
 Repeated uploading of copyrighted material
 Malicious account creation
 Edit summary vandalism
 Hidden vandalism
I did not do any of those things. In contrast and from the same page, vandalism is not:
 Tests by experimenting users
 Using incorrect wiki markup and manual of style
 NPOV violations
 Making bold edits
 Unintentional misinformation
 Unintentional nonsense
 Stubbornness
 Harassment or personal attacks
 Policy/guideline/essay/other project namespace page alteration
Out of the two lists my edits could only possibly fall into three categories, however I would disagree with two of them:
NPOV violation - I am removing POV from the article by ensuring CP is correctly quoted and that an alternative viewpoint is offered to the liberally biased criticism of the project
Stubbornness - if standing up for the truth and acting as a barrier to the liberal smears rampant on the project makes me stubborn then so be it, but history will judge me as being forced to engage in edit wars against other stubborn editors who refused to consider anything other than their liberal delusions
It is clear that my edits were not vandalism, and in labeling them as such you made a clear personal attack against me for which I demand an apology.

On the law of Kamma 

I have added a section on the law of Kamma. I prefer to call it Kamma (pali) instead of Karma ( sanskrit) as there is a negative meaning associated with Karma. Karma in the Hindu context means that ones deeds performed in previous lives are responsible for ones present conditions. This is a very pernicious Hindu doctrine and has been advanced by Hindu priests to escape from the social responsibility of alleaviting a man's condition. As per this doctrine all the poverty stricken, destitute people in this world must have been criminals in their previous lives. This cannot be true

The Buddhist law of kamma differs from the Hindu theory of Karma in this aspect. The buddhist law of kamma states that all actions are irreversable. That one cannot get rid of ones sins by asking for forgiveness or taking a bath in the holy river. An act once performed will leave its effect permanently on the society. It is the law of kamma that explains the maintainance of moral order in the world. It has nothing to do with the fortunes or misfortunes of people due to their actions in the previous birth.

 Vandalize?! 

I would have ignored your message normally (and by ignore I mean let you live), but why on earth would you call my edit ""vandalize"" while it obviously was not? I merely added a category that I thought was appropriate with absolutely no intent to ""vandalize"". You could've said it was something you don't agree with, or even something that most people who edit here don't agree with. You could've directed your ""warning"" at my (very real) threat. Like ""the next time you threaten someone"". Call me what you want, but I'm not a petty ""vandalizer"". I usually feel lazy to cross international lines to do just one thing, but I'm glad to tell you that you've signed your own death warrant and as long as you and the guy who reverted it are in the same country, both of you can look forward to a painful death very shortly.

Most of this seems a little premature. This article is incomplete in some sections.  The removal of superfluous tourist information is acceptable though, so is splitting off lists.  Perhaps some sections are complete, but 72k is not considered too long by WP:SIZE. Unnecessary splitting can sometimes cause unforseeable problems in the future. Because there already is a History article it makes sense to have a concise and brief history section.  But, I think splitting Economy should be held off for some time to come.

Focus on improving the article, make it not a list of lists but an article.  There are sections like Ecology that don't exsist, and Transportation and Culture which are woefully inadequate.

 How about an RFC then? 

Can we try an RFC?  I'd like to start with a brief neutral statement of the question and have others here respond with one statement each, link prior discussions if you like, limited to 1000 words, no rebuttals or arguments, then wait for comments from others, at least two days before any reactions.  The neutral question would be ""Should the title of this article be Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia, or Serbia under German Occupation, or something else; consider the prior talk sections above.""  I will not be making a statement myself, but I may respond after two days, or sooner if others decide not to respect the proposal.  OK?    
No. An RFC while there's an RM going on? Just list the RM on various noticeboards. And an RfC for what exactly? If someone wants to move the article - let him post an RM, that's what its for. We'd probably go through the whole annoying song and dance to no effect. And where's the sense in having an RM for a move to one title, while posting an RfC (of all things) for a move to another title??

I'm sure Antidiskriminator & Co. will jump at this, since for them whatever you (their perceived new-found ally )) propose and I oppose must be a good thing. But it makes no sense. I certainly won't accept any title that has not been agreed-upon in a proper RM, whatever the outcome of the RfC - indeed, if any. Additionally, an RfC may not be the most useful and effective means of DR here, since the dispute is immensely complex, obscure, and thoroughly bogged-down in misleading rhetorical nonsense. A ""vote on-the-fly"" would not be very helpful, and would probably be drowned in far-more-knowledgeable retorts from long-time participants.   (talk) "

Proposed paragraphs
""Option 1"" below shows the two paragraphs he (Hafen) is proposing. Now that I have read the Wiki guidelines suggested to me here and in other places, I can see that this might not fly. But I need to be able to tell him I tried with the text he suggested. I have another idea for a different approach that might be more acceptable (see option 2mine,  after option 1his). I would like your feedback.

Current: (to be replaced) Hafen denies that there is a biological link to sexual orientation, stating that same-sex attraction is ""not in your DNA"". He says that the American Psychological Association was politically motivated to remove homosexuality from its list of mental disorders.

Option 1:
As a Professor of Law at BYU from 1973-1996, his teaching and research focused on family law and education law, with particular interests in the legal rights of children and in the legal status of marriage.  A sample of his scholarly articles includes publications in the Harvard Law Review, Harvard International Law Journal, Michigan Law Review, Duke Law Journal, Ohio State Law Journal, and the American Bar Association Journal. Two of his articles were cited in opinions of the U.S. Supreme Court. He has been an invited speaker at professional conferences on family, education, and constitutional law in a variety of international and domestic locations.

In a 2009 speech in Utah, Hafen spoke to Evergreen International, a support group for people who desire to overcome their own same-gender attraction. A portion of his remarks summarized ?the secular case against same-gender marriage.? He cited the 2006 decision of the French parliament rejecting gay marriage so that children ?do not suffer as a result of situations imposed on them by adults.  The interest of the child must outweigh the exercise of freedom by adults, whatever life choices are made by the parents.?  He also stated that same-sex attraction is ?not in your DNA,? observing that while ?inherited susceptibilities? and ?natural personality traits do influence one?s inclinations? toward same-gender attraction, the ?idea that there is a ?gay gene?? that determines gender attraction ?has little scientific support.?  He stated that the gay rights movement represents ?an aggressive political movement? more than it represents ?substantive change in the medical or legal evidence.?  For example, he said, the decision of the American Psychological Association to remove homosexuality from its list of mental disorders in 1973 came from ?putting the issue to an open vote in their professional meetings?not because of any change in actual medical findings.? 

Option 2
In a 2009 speech in Utah, Hafen spoke to Evergreen International, a support group for people who desire to overcome their own same-gender attraction. His address generated a wide range of responses and was reported on in Salt Lake City's two major newspapers: the Salt Lake Tribuneand the Deseret News.
(I was thinking/hoping this would be neutral, because the Tribune gave a less-than-favorable report and the Deseret News gave a more favorable report. Referencing the two could offer some balance.)

 Im Juli DVD cover 

I'm not sure I understand the justification for this removal.  The image was the U.S. DVD cover, which should be no less fair-use than the original German cover.  I hadn't logged in for a while so the file was deleted before I could catch it, therefore I can't be sure whether the file had the appropriate fair use templates, but I seem to remember it did, and I thought the usual action would have been to tag the file rather than remove it.

Removal of Dead Kennedys reference. 

One such example is from Hardcore punk band The Dead Kennedys artwork for the back cover of their album Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death. The picture depicts a mock version of the original photo, with the American flag replaced by a Coca-Cola flag. The re-interpretation of this famous image signifes the band's ideology and belief in the evils of the corporatizing of America and the world.

I found an image of the Dead Kennedys cover  and it appears to have very little connection to the Iwo Jima photo.  Sure, it shows a flag raising, but a completely different one.  I have removed the above paragraph accordingly.

fowler fowler its not about who knows more of history,its about a community and we cant ignore what others say,and dont think that whatever other people say is false,cause confidence is good but overconfidence is not good!and see if u are writing about a history of community then write about their present also!and include some modern sources,and be neutral!u havent included jatt idols like Bhagat singh,Udham singh!and Abhinav bindra a gold medalist at Olympics in shooting,Yuvraj singh indian crickter,Harbhajan singh crickter,and Milkha singh gold meadlist in 1958 and 1962 olympics in 200m and 400m!
one more thing its written that jats used to practice widow remarriage but they used to practice only when it was allowed after reforms in the society and so what if they used to practice it afterall it was an evil practice,and let me tell u that even rajputs started practicing widow remarriage and rajputs and jats made their own rules cause they had power brahmins were only preists they had no actual power!cause kings and warriors have always more power than preiests!

Accusations of sockpuppetry 

To whom it may concern,

I would like to express my disgust at being accused of sockpuppetry. The accusation made by ChrisCh is baseless simply because more than myself have pointed out their objections to his extreme censorship of the Padua College wikipedia listing. I would further like to add my anger that a Wikipedia newcomer, Freedomfighter1112, has been indefinitely blocked for expressing his point-of-view. The actions taken by  and subsequently  I feel are actually in violation of Wikipedia's policy of not attacking the newcomers. It should be assumed that, in good faith, that Freedomfighter1112 would hope to assist the Wikipedia community in a positive way; however, with the actions taken by the two users mentioned previously, he/she has been prohibited from being able to accomplish this desire. We must remember that everyone makes mistakes, and mistakes are meant to be forgiven - especially in the case of a person's first edit. I would like to say only once - I DO NOT KNOW, OR HAVE ANY CONNECTION WITH FREEDOMFIGHTER1112 AND THAT THE ACCUSATION OF SOCKPUPPETRY IS BASELESS AND THE INDEFINITE BLOCK PLACED AGAINST FREEDOMFIGHTER1112 SHOULD BE OVERTURNED IMMEDIATELY.

Sincerely Yours,

Unlike some people, I read the Frankish Annals, Chronicles of the Priest of Doclea and Of managing an Empire, and I enjoyed in every single one of them. This Red Croatia most probably never existed after all (as a Croatian state) The other two historical sources are much more acurrate. We have the originals of them, and only a copy is preserved of the Priest's statement. But I have made careful studies, and made conclusions from all three (and agreed that all are completly correct) I will display it here soon.

 Short-term instability - possible mistake 

""What is known specifically about the IPK is that it exhibits a short-term instability of about 30 ?g over a period of about a month in its after-cleaned mass.[18]"" - from what I think is the BIPM's source for this, http://www.bipm.org/utils/en/pdf/Monographie1990-1-EN.pdf, it seems to be more like 4 ?g over a period of about four months for the IPK (figure 14 in that document).

Well, that's fair.  Charity is always good.  Money and morality don't have to be mutually exclusive.  It's just that before some jerk invented the idea of comparative value of material goods, human beings primarily existed by charity.  Morality was a given, and money was not needed.  Mutual interdependence.  And life was good.  There is nothing to steal when no one really owns anything.  And there is nothing to lose when people recognize that life is a flowing impermanent thing anywayour lives are on loan to us from the universe.  Nothing to hang on to, no need for property.  Now we live in an age where anything can be turned into a commodity, and most wealth is controlled by a few.  So, how can we be free when our lives revolve around money?

 This is often problematic. I've read these guidelines carefully several times, and there is a specific reference to the name ""Williams"" in the second one, but it's not a hard-and-fast rule, just a description of customary usage. It seems that, in both guidelines, the way the possessive form sounds best when pronounced is a good guideline. See MOS:POSS and Apostrophe#Possessive apostrophe, particularly these sections:

Basic rule (singular nouns)

Singular nouns ending with an ""s"" or ""z"" sound. See the second paragraph after the two bulleted items for specific discussion of the name Williams. Would you say ""Williams' wife"" or ""Williams's wife"", with the second one pronounced ""Williamses wife""? I don't know which one I would say; I've never known anyone with that last name. There is a small consideration: that ""Williams' wife"" sounds the same as ""William's wife"", with the second example being a man whose first name is William, but I don't know if that's a problem, especially in an article where it is clear that it is the man's last name. With ""Williams's wife"", it is clear beyond a doubt that his last name is ""Williams"". What do you think?   "

Ah, but is there relevance? If Sumple still supports his previous views, then there can be no defamation (no doubt he'll be proud to have a wider airing of his opinions), and if he doesn't, then he only has to retract in order to rectify the damage that his publically-stated views have caused. I for one am very offended. I feel it my duty to bring to the attention of the entire Wikipedian community the potential bias that might be introduced into edited articles. He only has to retract for us all to breathe a little easier.

 Talk: WikiProject Comics 

In the interest of everyone who watches the page for ongoing discussions, please stop making irrelevant, minor changes to the page simply so that you can ramble in an edit summary. People watch that page in the interest of relevant discussion. Also, it appears that for a few days you added two paragraphs to the page that didn't add to the discussion, only to revert them. Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Comics is on the watchlist of numerous editors, so if you could stop crowding it with nonsense that would be nice. Cheers.   
It wasn't nonsense. A topic was brought up regarding the contents of a certain story arc, and since it extensively quoted my story, character archetypes, scenes, etcetera, I very honestly filled in what the thematics were, as I am chronically upfront and very impulsive, but also tend to rethink and fix things I do that might have been a bad idea.  
Some of the involved people (or at least Kurt Parker used some of their catchphreases regarding me, whereas I remember Joe Quesada mentioning that he considers ""Spidey"" his favourite fan several years ago), censored it.  I do have a problem with that the ones responsible didn't just talk with me directly from the start and explain the situation clearly, rather than attacking, and then didn't even have the decency to actually stand for the very statistically unlikely yet real ridiculously extreme hate-tirade against me. I mean, I as good as always stand for anything I do, and it is all comparatively extremely trivial.  
Yet I've apparently got lots of western comics crossover, movies, tv series, computer games, books, and manga inexplicably focusing extensively on me in some kind of vendetta for a long time, which is extremely confusing for somebody literalminded with limited sensory filters like myself.  One obscure story to process and put horrible input I had been exposed to behind me (well, 30000 visits counts as obscure in my book), and almost completely random Wikipedia nad tvtropes edits somehow equalled a global media campaign reaching hundreds of millions, while declaring me a genocidal lunatic...  My ""does not compute blinkers"" have gone haywire for quite a while now to say the least...   

That said, please quit doing it, regardless of what imaginary pop-culture vendetta you're talking about. If you can't control making edits that do nothing but serve as a soapbox, go somewhere else. Otherwise, it's like someone who can't control their bladder going to a water park. It just causes problems.   "

As far as the article itself is concerned, here are some problems which should be corrected before continuing.
Sources

Your sources are sometimes trivial and do not contribute to the overall article.

 Trivial mention of PGJ, more focused on gold and the industry in general

 Trivial mention of the company, focuses again more on industry and economy. More of a press release.

 Trivial mention of award.

I concur with the above analysis, as I have already said before. The crux of the above issue simply refers to the fact that Nicky Bird wrote that in Beever's book ""Statistics proliferate, and are unverifiable"", and the text inserted into the Wikipedia article said that this same estimate ""has been questioned by Nicky Bird"". As noted, at one point Nicky Bird's article was directly quoted so that readers could understand his viewpoint in his own words. YMB29 could possibly have been sanctioned for many things, but I still can't understand how an indefinite ban for misrepresentation was justified. I wonder if YMB29's ban can be reduced to ""time served""?  "

Just FYI, on the French wiki, we finally chose to talk about proto-State. Palestine has numerous features of a State (starting by recognition) but lack some others (eg a define territory and a control of this). It is a State de jure -partly- but not really de facto -with some exception-. So it is a State in building: a proto-State.
Some sources (in French) use that wording. I don't know in English.

If people see all the dollar signs they will know Wikipedia is no fan of Microsoft's evil methods of making money by cheating others with inferior software and destroying competitors. 

If you are one of the people who actually writes Wikipedia, I suggest you add information to the Microsoft article, about how they have cheated people. I know many people have their edits reverted quickly, so I'm not going to bother spending lots of time on edits which will be reverted quickly. My method is fast and effecient - it just takes me a few minutes, and by hitting 20 pages, by the time someone reverts everything, there'll be some passing readers who will see my work and see how Microsoft cheats people.

I'm going to check with SingNet whether they offer shared IPs - if so, I'll sign up for an account with them. I have a friend who uses AOL who would be interested in helping me with this. Perhaps if we have 10 ISPs which use dynamic IPs or IPs shared by thousands of people, and we keep doing this, anonymous editing will have to be completely prohibited. I once edited constructively with an account, and I know everything that's going wrong with Wikipedia - including allowing anonymous editing. If doing this will help you and other Wikipedians open their eyes to the problems here, I will stop.

Build a website, then reference that website as his source? It's ridiculous to say the least.

 Ragusa- Dubrovnik- has never been in Italy!
This article's statement in the part of ""Maratime Republics"" claiming that Ragusa was in Italy and therefore implying that it was an Italian republic is clearly a mistake.
One just needs to go into the Sponza palace, the Ragusian state archive in Dubrovnik and see any of the official documents. The laws regarding inner policy are clearly stated in Croatian: Those regarding foreign policy are written both in Croatian and Italian. All of the ruling families of Ragusa from Sorkocevic to Gucetic to Restic etc were Croatian. The greatest Ragusian poet and writer Ivan Gundulic, an aristocrat and one of the rulers, famous for his book ""Suze sina razmetnoga"", was one of the greatest Croatian nationalists.  Source: ""Dubrovnik, a history"", written by Robin Harris 2006.
According to the Robert Harris book Malta was independent until 1808 when Napoleon annexed it. According to Harris Dubrovnik with it's fleet of 700.000 tons (surpassing Venice in 1660) was the main hated rival of Venice in the Adriatic and always resisted the invasion plans of Venice. The last Venitian rector was sent home packing- politely but firmly- in 1351. According to Harris the recto packed his belongings in a hurry.

Some reflections  on this issue are necessary

First, it is necessary a reflection on the very concepts of Nation and State as these two terms are commonly considered near-synonyms and therefore used interchangeably. They have, instead different meanings. The term Italy refers to booth meanings. Italy as State was born in XIX cent, but Italy as Natiom is much older. Almost true, Ragusa never belonged to Italy-State except the Napoleon's Kingdom of Italy (1808-1809), but was seen for some centuries a part of Italy-Nation in the beginning of its birth process. Today Ragusa/Dubrovink, as well as Split and other Dalmatian towns, are out of Italy-State and out of Italy-Nation as well, they belong both to Croatia-Nation and to Croatia-State. On the other hand Lugano (Switzerland) and San Marino (independent republic) are out of Italy-State and still part of Italy-Nation. I suggest the book: L. TOMAZ, ""Il confine d'Italia in Istria e Dalmazia. Duemila anni di storia"" and the SSRN working paper: ARNALDO MAURI, Historical, Geopolitical and Economic Factors affecting State and Nation Boundaries: Foreword on Italy's Borders in Istria and Dalmatia.,  Of course, Ragusa as port city had a multiethnic population: besides Italians also Croats, Vlachs, Serbs, Albanians. Similar situations could be found in Istanbul, Alexandria, Izmir, Odessa. To be the birthplace of poets or outstanding men is insignificant. Tommaseo was born in Dalmatia, as many other great Italians, Garibaldi and Massena were born in Nice, the Greek poet Kavafis in Alexandria. Venice was rival of Ragusa, but was also rival of Genoa on the sea and of Milan on the mainland; also this point is insignificant to the discussion on Ragusa belonging to Italy-Nation in past centuries.87.9.19.187  

Romanians in 2007/2008

I think now that Romanians are the largest minority in Italy, someone should add this fact from this year.

Hi again Bo [will just use the abbreviation for speed],
Not much time at the moment since I'm in the midst of a project but wanted to respond to a few points.
First of all, thanks for your kind, even-toned replies to my questions and expressions of  irritation. I DO think that WikiP should have an avenue of complaint for users  from my recent experience, it seems contributors can get stuck in an endless loop of Admins (or whatever titles you and your editorial colleagues have), never reaching someone with the authority to resolve complaints. You and others have referred vaguely to the ""process"" of Copyvio review, but I have no idea who does that, when they do it, or how to reach them to defend my position/claims.
1. I sometimes find a ""You have a message waiting"" notice. How is that genrated? Do you get this same notice when I post on your User page? Is there a way to send a messaage directly to you so it won't be visible to the world  e.g. if I needed to provide you an email address or something I didn't want posted here?
2. Regarding Crapsey. I did indeed check various sources in writing the article. And if you read the EB citation and my piece, you'll see that mine is quite different, not at all a sentence-by-sentence paraphrase. It differs in style and wording from the outset to the end and contains far more detail than EB. Moreover, Crapsey is a local legend in Rochester, and I had no need to consult Brittanica  I don't know how you folks access EB, but I stopped using it years ago when they went from a free to a pay service that only provides ""teaser"" articles that are virtually useless. Thus, the entry non-members get for Crapsey is the following truncated info:
http://www.britannica.com/eb/article?tocId=9125441
We have never been EB ""trial"" members or subscribers; it would appear that you folks at WikiP do have some sort of membership, however. Is that correct?
3. Regarding Sock Puppetting, I was adapting your own WikiP term for those who use ""dummy"" accounts (or have friends act in concert with them) to insure they get the posting they want. It was beginning to appear that your colleagues were teaming up in a Revert War. In fact, they did just that in another article we posted about area poet William Heyen  they kept Copyvio-ing it, though in fact it was written by us for our own journal, Exit Online. When I pointed this out, I was told, in effect, ""Oh yeah? Well, prove it!"""" I have no idea what sort of ""proof"" one can offer for owning someone one has posted to their own web site (or any other web site for that matter). More to the point, THEY offered no suggestions as to how one might ""prove it."" If you have an email address for someone at WikiP who oversees this sort of stuff, then let me know and we'll be happy to contact him/her.
4. As for ""my article,"" I was referring to the fact that it's mine by virtue of the fact that I authored it. In fact, your own guidelines specifically state that the author of each edit is the author and has only granted a GFDL license, so that author can be said to be the owner of that particular edit. That could even be the whole article. For this reason, the authors don't have to comply with the GFDL requirements for their own writing - the GFDL license doesn't override their own rights to use their own work. They can also license it to any number of others under any other licenses they choose, since that's one of the rights authors have.
5. Thanks for your candor over concerns about EB suits over copyright. Maybe EB has folks that spend their days doing nothing but monitor WikiP, though I somehow doubt it since they would not have access to the same ""new posting"" info that you and your colleagues use to monitor postings. It would take an army of staff even to randomly check WikiP listings.
6. As for creating an account, in fact, my colleagues and I do have accounts and would, indeed, like the ""credit"" for our efforts. However, given the recent unpleasant incidents we've encountered that include threats of being blocked/blacklisted, I'm sure you can understand why anonymity seems preferable for the moment.
7. I'll have to check into templates. I suspected you might be using some sort of boilerplate, and this is precisely why using forms can be so dangerous.

Good point, I don't expect to see the article deleted so I won't bother.  It's clear that wikipedia is not a truly representative forum and that it has been taken over by hacks, zealots and vandals who have become adminsitrators, largely it would appear (based on Connolly's bio) due to the fact that they don't have productive employment obligations elsewhere.  I, fortunately do have such obligations and expect to be out yelled, screamed, reverted and controlled.  Ultimately however, this will not alter the fact that you are *wrong* in your fundamental philosophy, and this new fascism will ultimately die as the other forms have.  The issue really is how many people will be harmed by these fascists that are using global weapon as their latest justification for increasing the state's control over our lives, following racial arguments, nationalist arguments, and worker's rights arguments.

I'm struggling to see what the current dispute is about after my enforced spell in the slammer.  Karbinski argues for ""Philosophy is the science that studies the fundamental aspects of the nature of existence in order to provide man with a comprehensive view of life. Major branches of Philosophy include Metaphysics, Epistemology, Ethics, Politics, and Aesthetics. The word philosophy is of Ancient Greek origin: ????????? (philosoph?a), meaning ""love of knowledge"", ""love of wisdom""""

I prefer a return to the main four branches.  Deleting the 'reasoned argument' part is not supported by the sources, of which there are plenty.  Philosophy would be a science in the original meaning of 'science' (scientia) but the modern meaning, while not entirely different, has connotations that it would be best to avoid.  On whether the philosophy of language belongs in the main branches, that is debateable.  My view, given the dominance of the 'Old Logic' (the Categories and On Interpretation) and of the importance of those two to the Metaphysics, I would say it does belong.    "

Not sure the recent edit changing Tyler from ""Anarchist"" to ""Nihilist"" is accurate. Tyler certainly does have a ethos and creed, where as a nihilist does not. His creed can certainly be said to be destruction of the current culture and certainly retrograde in many respects, seeking to return to a simpler subsistence level of existence (i.e. hunter/gatherer) but he definitely has an established ethos and world-view. It is simply contrary to much of modern society. I posit that the edit should be reverted back to anarchist.  17:56, Apr 9, 2004 (UTC)

Reader's Digest, Jack/Joe
Hey, a few years ago I was reading a really old Reader's Digest and I swear I actually read an article written first person from an organ's point of view.  (I don't remember which.)

...and the guy's name was Joe.

This was before I read the book, so I just thought it was a really odd coincidence at the time...I can't seem to find the article anymore, though.  Does anyone else have any info on this?  Was Joe changed to Jack to avoid legal troubles with the original ""Joe's XXXXXX"" author?

 The author of the book was talking about real stories from Reader's Digest, so you probably did read the same ones he refered to. ""Joe"" is changed to ""Jack"" in the movie because Reader's Digest wasn't willing to allow them to mention it in the film.  LGagnon

I have a copy of John Pekkanen's article ""I am John's Brain Tumour"", from Reader's Digest (South Africa) 1990-12, volume 137, number 824. Chapter 7 of my copy of Palahniuk's Fight club has ""I am Jane's Uterus. I am Joe's Prostate. [...] I am totally Joe's Gallbladder"", ISBN 0-099-28333-6, Vintage (1997) UK Random House. The English RD sites I searched came up empty. The earliet ""Joe""s I found were two 1974 videos  from ""Pyramid Films"". I found that ""Pyramid Media"" credits it to RD . Does anyone have a source of an actual Reader's Digest article with ""Joe""? - , 2004-04-15t22:37z

 It is mentioned on the commentary for the DVD that Reader's Digest told them not to use ""Joe"". Apperantely they own the copyright somehow. Either way, the narrator in the book does use Joe rather than Jack. And given that the book is the original story, I believe that ""Joe"" should be used more often in the article than ""Jack"" (though ""the narrator"" fits the character's ""name"" more accurately). The article seems to lean too much towards being about the movie, which makes it seem as if it was the original source material instead of the book. It would be best that we keep the article based mainly on the book, with details on the movie where applicable. Otherwise, what we would be doing would be the equivelent of someone making the Lord of the Rings article more about the Peter Jackson movie than JRR Tolkien's work.  LGagnon

Tyler section
We should merge the Tyler Durden section into the characters section. There isn't a need for 2 separate sections on him. As it is it looks redundant and a bit sloppy. Any details that don't fit that section can go into a different one.  LGagnon

Backstory of the novel
I just recently updated the article on Chuck Palahniuk with info on how Fight Club came to be. This is in the first paragraph of the Biography section. I was wondering if anyone thought we should include that info in this article, since it gives the backstory of how it was written.   Talk]] 12:00, 27 Jul 2004 (UTC)

Movie & Book Balance
As I mentioned above at the end of the Reader's Digest, Jack/Joe section, the article is ""biased"" towards the movie (that is, the info for the film is treated as being the primary source instead of the book), and needs to be balanced equally for the book. I have fixed a recent re-write of the plot section (which made it even more biased in favor of the film), but more work could be done to balance the article.

list of surgeons 
 Recently, the list of surgeons has been removed by  without discussion or note in these talk pages, with the claim that it is promotional. I disagree with the characterization of the physician list. I do not believe it promotes any given surgeon when all the major such surgeons are listed. In this context I do not believe this list is at all promotional. Those surgeons hardly need promotion, when their waiting lists are already six months or more deep. I also believe it is important to list these people so that nobody ever gets the misimpression that such surgery is performed primarily by anyone other than reputable, accredited plastic surgeons who are members of the ASPS and other relevant organizations. In this specific case, I also believe that it is important to humanize the existence of this surgery with the names of its actual practitioners. Let us not disappear the FFS surgeons to an anonymous status, when the work they do is so vitally important to its recipients. Removal of the surgeon list also decreases the verifiability of this article's contents. (That is another matter which should be addressed - this article needs some reference citations at its end.) There may be another reasons that the list of names should be maintained. Please feel free to add to the list. I will wait to restore this list until others have had an opportunity express there opinions.

, can you compare the versions? I find 's version to be extremely bloated. It is faulty in a number of ways:
""List of feature films"" has an extraneous column that provides very little useful information; one could easily say in a sentence above it that one studio distributed the first two trilogies and that another started with the latest trilogy.
Poor merging of planned films into the main list of films, because trying to sort by ""Story Order"" screws up the table badly
""Reception"" was stolen wholesale from Star Wars; this redundancy is unnecessary, and the section can be linked to in the ""See also"" section
Overall, the version suffers from scope creep. Most Star Wars articles are prose-heavy. This list should be a way to simply list the films for readers, especially with the start of anthology films. They shouldn't be left to go through prose or table bloat to figure that out. ?(talk?|?contrib) (ping me) "

 Incorrect translation of quotations and improper combination of quotations from source 

In the discussion of the Pope's positions on poverty and inequality, there is an overly literal and incorrect translation of a quote from La Naci?n. When interpreting or translating, the goal is to accurately convey meaning and ideas, not words, from the source language to the target language. Also, the Wikipedia entry takes from the La Naci?n article two different quotes and combines them as if they were a single quote. It is inappropriate to treat exact quotations in such a manner. The discussion of the Pope?s comments about the poor should be re-written as follows: During a May 2010 speech in Argentina regarding the poor, he chastised ""the comfortable"" whom ""avoided considering""  the poor, saying: ""We have no right to look away, to turn down the arms raised by the desperate."" rodneygriffith"

All I said was that McFly were a bad band and mentioned that The Daily Mail had published a piece saying Arbeit Macht Frei wasn't such a bad Nazi slogan.  Neither of these statements are trolling but the former is subjective and I wouldn't put it in an entry.  Christian is always bleating on about people reacting to his own subjective views, and to his right-wing assertions.  And then he complains to administrators who haven't always got the time to look at his history, and some of whom seem to enjoy playing god and go way over the top, watching carefully so that they can justify blocking poor bastards like me.  You must be a bit bored, the pair of you.  I have a 12 year old daughter.  If she does something that I perceive as naughty I don't use it as an excuse a year later to ban her from going out with her friends.

 A Short History of Progress edits 

Hi there Maclean, I will try to keep this short. I noticed your rewrite and you did some good work (and a lot it too) and thanks for that: plenty of review references also. 
Although I actually prefer the original but this is probably a matter of style and preference.
The good side is that now the original is defunct and no longer published at Wikipedia I can effectively take it back at least by fact although I know not really by law.  I am going to move on from Wikipedia into my own blog...
Things have a habit of getting dumbed down here particularly into mediocre and ineloquent English.
It is a bit cookbookish now: section by section of the Author's book...
Also I don't actually like the Background paragraph style as this should go into the Author Bio page otherwise you would have repeat it for ever Article for every book by that Author!?
Hence the downside of a cookbook or templated approach. 
Question: are foootnoted references to say comparison with other Authors considered original Research?
Also I couldnt find your original ref online but Martin Scoresse does not appear on Cinemaginaire's page for the film as an executive producer - given his preemminence I would pretty much take this as indicating that he is no longer associated with the project?
Also although you keenly summarized/precis some of the quotes (particular the first intro one) there were a few bits (perhaps cut down) I would still like to see in the article particularly from his concluding remarks ""an ice age hunter gather, clever but seldom wise"" etc and the last Easter islander bit as they are muost poignant and expressive rendered thus in the authors own words than in a cookbook summary of the book.  (I had this same difficulty once summarizing Nietzsche for an essay and in the end largely used the authors own words: how can one after all precis Nietzsche!)
Please don't be offended.  Maybe we should collaborate a little as I have no doubt that we will get a better result than either of us would otherwise on our own. 
Respond here or at my User Mattjs discussion page. (I rarely log in any more but will do so to check.) I will check back here in a few weeks or so (maybe longer) and make a few changes above after your feedback.
Regards 122.148.41.172   (Now i'm off to print and save an older copy for the Article for myself ;-))"

The fact that they only appear to have been added (here and on the main CtM page) after the episodes screened also rings alarm bells. I am therefore going to delete them until someone can come up with an official source that endorses them.

Daizus, what you need to do is find a reliable scholar that makes the same arguments you make about what Boia says, and cite him or her saying them  in reply to Boia (and not in a dialog that you set up), without introducing weasel words to raise your point from the ground, and without launching into your own theories about how ancient writers used to gather material. For starters. 
As for the rest: you need to find yourself reliable historians that say this and that, cite them saying it, and differentiate between them and Boia, with the knowledge of the fact that you will also allow other criticisms to be expressed. Regardless of my unfamiliarity with the subject, I know that historians of the antiquity in Romania and elsewhere also doubt the identification, and I know that it is prevalent in Romanian historiography for very political reasons.
For these reasons, the merger is POV. Even if the prevalent tone would be that historians agree Dacians and Gatae are one and the same (and I doubt it will ever be), the debate is likely to be open forever, and we need to give readers that information, not the one that suits us.

Sci Rev dead ?

Hi Ragesoss. What's happening on the SR article ? Has Steve resigned ? Given no response to my last series of criticisms, various edits now required. Seems to me revolution knocked out as it stands. I cannot help reconstruct given I deny there was a revolution, but only help with accurate historical and logical analysis of the (non-revolutionary) developments in the centuries of interest. The main problem of standard 17th century revolutionism for mechanics is essentially Duhem's deconstruction of alleged key developments of the alleged 17th century scientific revolution into the 12th to 14th centuries that essentially still stands. Perhaps details of that should replace the final 'literary criticism' section you removed ? Anyway, article's surely in an appallingly confused 'nowhereland' state at the moment. Might be more educationally responsible to delete it entirely and put an 'article in construction' notice. Just an idea.

Kmccoy, I agree with you. If you look at my changes today, I included only the birth dates of the two children who are now adults (one of whom has a Wikipedia article already) with three independent sources for Track?s birth date of 20 April 1989, and I included the birth date for baby Trig, since he was SO MUCH in the news last year. I was trying to find a compromise position. There is no consensus here for including or for excluding, and, if you read previous talk pages, you will see no consensus there either.

In the spirit of erring on the side of more information (Wikipedia?s mission is to inform, after all), I made today?s revision. The immediate reversion, wiping out all birth dates, except that of little Tripp Johnston (certainly the most irrelevant birth date of all), is a bit risible and does not demonstrate any consensus either. As for the sources, I shall find better ones, but that argument is a red herring. No one has found any other birth date for Track other than 20 April 1989. All the sources (weaker or stronger) agree on the birth date.

I have read WP:UNDUE. It supports including neutral factual information. Birth dates fall into that category. I really don?t see where the problem is here. I shall not continue to include the birth dates in the article, but this demonstrates that Wiki-articles need more consistent management. It is troubling that there is a small minority who insist upon exclusion when Wikipedia should stand for inclusion.

Yes people who are interested in reading a whole play would likely concur with each play summary. Yes, I am vacillating on the need to cite secondary source.  However, since there is objection to citing primary sources, I have gone back to requesting secondary sources.  In an article about an episode of a given TV series or about a fictional character from a television series, it is common to cite the primary source.  However, in this case, I do believe secondary sources abound on the subject.  Why not cite them.  Saying all readers of WP would know how to verify this unattributed claim of what the plot is seems to be a bit of a stretch in terms of adaquate sourcing.  Please find some source preferably secondary, but at worst primary so that each plot summary is sourced somehow. (t/c//WP:CHICAGO/WP:LOTM)

Whilst I don't agree with your reasoning, I am happy to add my ""reference"" to Further Reading rather than References. It is not really self-promotion to add an worthy but out-of-print book as further reading for those interested in the subjects. Certainly less self promotional than some of the press references which are basically just PR releases given spurious credibility by being recycled in the mainstream press. Sadly, much of what passes for journalism today is just PR stuff, which begs the question of how seriously we should take a lot of references!   

Well I might dabble in such edits, if I had more time. To be honest, I don't give tuppence whether my books are mentioned or not. It is of no advantage whatsoever to me, commercial or egotistical. I merely thought I was helping but clearly have transgressed Wiki's arcane guidelines, often inconsistent from what I can see. And to be honest, I do believe that people may have used my book without true attribution, there are one or two things mentioned that are so obscure that it would be rather a coincidence if they hadn't been read first in my book. Hopefully I'll not be tempted to dabble in Marmite, of which I know a great deal!

The example is a poor one, and should be removed from the article. The article states that it seems to require 5 colors, presumably because the grey area cannot simply be colored red, yellow or blue without re-coloring. However, it *can* be colored green, and that doesn't require shuffling any of the other colors around. This makes it a very misleading counterexample. I know I spent a lot of time scratching my head wondering why this was considered a counter-example at all, and how the caption made any sense. Please either replace it with an example which does need to be re-colored in order to work or remove it (not that I don't think it's a valiant attempt, but it's just confusing).

" For example, a prior discussion: The whole story of Frank Dux and the Kumite is a fraud. There is no such thing as the ""Kumite"" tournament.

Does anyone honestly believe that such a world class underground full contact tournament could have gone on, and there would remain no evidence of it beside Dux's testimony? Anyone who could produce evidence of such a thing would have a million dollar story, but no one has. Wouldn't someone eventually come forward, or one or two fighters maybe speak out against it? What about the families of the fighters? Wouldn't they notice that their loved ones come home with broken bones and missing teeth? Dux himself claims that there were fatalities. In that case wouldn't the families of the dead fighters investigate what happened? Dux further claims that there were spectators gambling in the event (as in the movie), then how could they keep the silence of the spectators for all these years? To this day there remains no video, or pictures or anything to substantiate Dux's claims.

Dux further claims that he holds the record for the fastest ""kick with a knockout"" at 72 mph. This makes no sense whatsoever. Is there a cop with a radar gun next to ring, measuring the speed of every strike? A 72 mph kick seems impossible, as swords don't even swing that fast. Someone wouldn't just ""jump into"" such an event either, but they would have training partners, and a record of their fighting career. They would have won tournaments, and fought in other full-contact venues (like ones that actually exist), yet their is no footage or evidence of Dux's participation in such events. He is a martial artist, but nothing like he claims.

The only thing that's been knocked out here is Dux's credibility. Soldier of Fortune magazine exposed his lies about his military career. Using the Freedom of information act they showed that the actual years of his service in the military don't match up with his claims. He could have never served in Vietnam, and was never a special op like he claims. They exposed a picture of him in the military as a hoax, by showing that the ribbons and medals on his uniform are inconsistent with his branch of service. His own response to this is that the uniform was a costume that he was wearing on the way to a halloween party. You gotta be kidding me. Dux sued them for libel and lost.

He also sued Jean Claude Van Damme, saying that he (Dux) had come up with the story for the movie ""The Quest"", and that Van Damme had made a contract with him for royalties that were never paid. Dux failed to produce any evidence of such a contract, and claimed that the missing evidence was destroyed in an earthquake. Van Damme's lawyer ripped Dux's credibility to shreds, showing that Dux's apartment was not damaged like he said it was, and produced a cast of witnesses to support that Dux is a story teller and pathological liar.

In his book, Dux goes on to make other astounding claims about being a real life James Bond character working for the CIA during the 80's, and many more fantastic tales. The publisher (Harper Collins) pulled the book, and not due to poor sales either. Maybe because they realized they had been duped by this guy, just like the producers of the movie Bloodsport. Just goes to show how little credibility Hollywood has, even when they make the claim that something is based on a true story. 71.233.140.67 (talk) 

    * First, let me say I agree with you. I want to make that clear, because you're not going to like the answer I have to give you. Read WP:TRUTH and one of the first things you will see is: ""Truth is not the criteria for inclusion of any idea or statement in a Wikipedia article, even if it is on a scientific topic. The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth?that is, whether readers are able to check that material added to Wikipedia has already been published by a reliable source, not whether we think it is true."" I don't like that. You probably won't either, but that is the state of affairs. Those excellent questions you asked? Those are considered original research WP:OR. If someone else asks them in a reliable source, then we can add that to this article. But until they do, we can't. Although we can all edit here, we don't own Wikipedia. So when Dux disagrees with something and decides to sue, he doesn't come after Niteshift36 (although he might try), he comes after Wikipedia. The standard for biographies of living people WP:BLP is even higher than for articles about the deceased or other topics. I can't, for example say that Mr. John Doe is a lying a-hole on Wikipedia if he is still alive. I can't even say it on a talk page or my own user page. But if a writer in Time magazine does an interview where his former boss calls Doe a lying a-hole, we can possibly include that. There are a lot of people who have asked the questions you did. I

Over-use of shy template 

I have reversed your 89 uses of the shy template at Jean Berko Gleason, and thought I should explain why.Unfortunately, the Wikipedia search treats all the part-words, each side of the shy template, as separate words, so they appear as a vast number of mis-spellings,  Although useful for very long words, such as the example at Template:Shy, it should be used sparingly - the third word of a line, is highly unlikely to need splitting as a line-end word, whilst breaking words across two lines makes them much harder to read. It really doesn't matter if there is a short space at the end of a line, although very long spaces can be confusing as to whether the sentence has come to a premature, abrupt, end or not.-

If you think about it, most every word in English was borrowed from some other language, because words are very rarely invented out of nothing.  ""Pizza"" was taken from Italian, but is really a routine English word now.  It's not exactly some esoteric word used in specific contexts, like yakuza or jihad.

Whether offtopic or not (and I don't think they are), many of the threads are entirely redundant. I say we merge the following sections 'Please Remove this Article', 'This article is clearly mindless bigotry' and possibly 'Some findings ridiculous' are merely arguments as to whether the hypothesis is valid. They are not discussions on the article itself, and how to make sure it's NPOV. I'm tempted to go ahead with some reorganization of the page, without deleting.

Edits on Bombardier CSeries page 

Dear Tagremover,
thank You for Your edits on the Bombardier CSeries page, I trust they were performed on good faith.
Although I would like to tell You that the reference You used (Bombardier CSeries Factsheet) is an old brochure from January 2009. Also the French and Japanese articles on the Bombardier CSeries are outdated and still list the ER versions of the aircraft.
During 2012, Bombardier removed all references to the ER and XT versions from their factsheets, this was discussed on the article's discussion page and a revision was promptly made to the section in the article (with this edit, dated December 18, 2012).
Furthermore, in March 2013, Bombardier revised several key data (like aircraft's dimensions and performance data) and I performed a full review of the specifications section in the article's page (with this edit, dated March 8, 2013).
Thank You for Your understanding,

I disagree, especially as you're talking about a comparison that was being made in 2004 when Wikicities had that name. The GeoCities article states ""GeoCities was the third-most visited website on the World Wide Web, behind AOL and Yahoo!."" - that's not negative. Anyway, the whole thing should probably be removed since most people were not making any such comparisons. Instead, people were assuming it was a wiki site for cities which is why the name was dropped in 2006. 58.168.75.100  "

The payment scheme of the heraldic officers is ambiguous: Are the sums mentioned paid per day of work, a week, a month or a year? I know it sounds like a silly question at first, but since it _is_ mentioned that the payment is only nominal, one is left to wonder.

Sorry, but no.  It only limits readers to that specific category.

But in this case, it was not needed.  * helps expand the readers view of the entire company and their subsidaries as well especially related sectors if they want to research it more.

"==Number of Adepts ==
Because Spiritist Moviment doesn't proselytizes and is not a religious denomination (as states in the article), there is no current estimation for the number of Spiritists in Brazil. The IBGE estimation came from the census on religion, but many Spiritists do not consider themselves Spiritism ""followers"", because it is not a religion.  Another poll made by a established poll research institution in Brazil shows that half of Brazilian population believes in reincarnation. Once Buddhism and Hinduism are almost non-existent in Brazil, it shows the strong influence of The Spiritist Doctrine and other native believes in Brazil. Moreover, in another poll (Rede Globo Mineira, 2000) in the populous State of Minas Gerais, Chico Xavier, the most popular spiritist medium in   Brazil, was elected the Mineiro (Minas's citizen) of the century, competing against other popular celebrities like the former President Juscelino Kubischeck and inventor Santos Dumont. Recently Epoca Magazine comments an statistic of 20 to 30 millions of spiritists in Brazil. For the reasons above I'm removing the badly grounded statistics about the number of spiritists in Brazil.

Wow arent you rude. When the article no longer deals in accusations then it can be renamed something other then allegations ... So instead of making factually wrong articles the goal should be to fix the Syria article, not break everything else to be like the broken ones. Not really sure where bias comes in, its like stating if we call one white man a racist we need to call them all racists, its wrong to do so, but we need them all to be wrong so they match ... that makes little sense and if you are going to ignore my arguement it shows you have no counter claim.

Effectiveness of Lamictal 

That section appears to be wrong. Lamictal is effective at Prophylaxis or delaying the mania, depressive, or rapid cycle. It is not effective more than a placebo in current state of either of those. You can read citation 8 ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2580079/ ) whereas I think I read it and understand it more than whoever wrote that line. Lamictal's own perscriber guide says it is effective at DELAYING any of those three, INCLUDING RAPID CYCLE mania. It published those two studies. It did not publish the studies that say it is not effective at treating CURRENT any of those episodes.  http://us.gsk.com/products/assets/us_lamictal.pdf . please agree somehow to fix that section. 173.55.18.122

 Wikipedia and copyright 
 Hello DABAIJING, and welcome to Wikipedia. Your addition to Twitterature has had to be removed, as it appears to have added copyrighted material without permission from the copyright holder. While we appreciate your contributing to Wikipedia, there are certain things you must keep in mind about using information from your sources to avoid copyright or plagiarism issues here.

You can only copy/translate a small amount of a source, and you must mark what you take as a direct quotation with double quotation marks ("") and a cited source. You can read about this at Wikipedia:Non-free content in the sections on ""text"". See also Help:Referencing for beginners, for how to cite sources here.
Aside from limited quotation, you must put all information in your own words and structure, in proper paraphrase. Following the source's words too closely can create copyright problems, so it is not permitted here; see Wikipedia:Close paraphrasing. (There is a college-level introduction to paraphrase, with examples, hosted by the Online Writing Lab of Purdue.) Even when using your own words, you are still, however, asked to cite your sources to verify information and to demonstrate that the content is not original research. 
Our primary policy on using copyrighted content is Wikipedia:Copyrights. You may also want to review Wikipedia:Copy-paste. 
If you own the copyright to the source you want to copy or are a designated agent, you may be able to license that text so that we can publish it here. However, there are steps that must be taken to verify that license before you do. See Wikipedia:Donating copyrighted materials.
In very rare cases (that is, for sources that are public domain or compatibly licensed), it may be possible to include greater portions of a source text. However, please seek help at the help desk before adding such content to the article. 99.9% of sources may not be added in this way, so it is necessary to seek confirmation first. If you do confirm that a source is public domain or compatibly licensed, you will still need to provide full attribution; see Wikipedia:Plagiarism for the steps you need to follow.
Also note that Wikipedia articles may not be copied or translated without attribution. If you want to copy or translate from another Wikipedia project or article, you can, but please follow the steps in Wikipedia:Copying within Wikipedia.

It's very important that contributors understand and follow these practices, as policy requires that people who persistently do not must be blocked from editing. If you have any questions about this, you are welcome to leave me a message on my talk page.  Thank you.    "

User:Toomanywordstoolittletime? 

For what its worth, I disagree with your characterization of  as a spammer; I believe they were a new editor contributing in good faith, who does not understand Wikipedia policies and guidelines.  I had been having a discussion with the user over the past few days on my talk page regarding their articles Jenny Sawyer and 60second Recap.  It was only today, after they restored the 60second Recap article that they began adding the external links.  

Granted, they were making a lot of promotional entries, but they had also been doing some minor fixes to articles.  They do seem to have some ownership issues, which frequently makes alignment towards working within site guidelines difficult (and sometimes impossible); but I had hoped they could be made a productive contributor to Wikipedia. -  (talk ? contribs) -

We're taking a little breather.""[5] On January 20, 2012, the site was modified to explain the hacking.[6]
On January 27, 2012, The President's Challenge sent out emails to its participants saying that the Web site was functional as of January 24, 2012, and asked participants to reset their user passwords.[7][8]""(End quote)

Can somebody explain why these notes are included? I suggest deleting them on the following grounds: The hacking incident was not a milestone event in the history of this movement. By this I mean it did not change the name or the aim of the organization. It did not amount to a major disruption to the program, and it seems trivial compared to all other items in the History section.   "

Saudi-Arabia provided more assistance to Hamas than Iran? Prove? 

In the article it says this
Iran has provided funding to Hamas but more funding has come from Saudi Arabia and also from the Sunni Arab countries like Qatar, UAE etc. and refers to this article: http://www.economist.com/node/12959539?story_id=12959539

But this claim quoted above is not traceable anywhere in the article. Therefore I ask to remove that part, please.

Bad Agendas written in to this article
Hello folks, I'm not a wiki-writer.  I just use it from time to time.  But I am familiar with problems when some pages have points of view and agendas written in to them, and the American Civil War articles are rife with these problems.  You'd think the war was still on.  This article on the 43rd Battalion is generally very good, but someone has done their best to wreck the ship, nevertheless.  A paragraph in this article goes off-track and attempts to paint a picture that these soldiers were ""guerillas"".  Anyone familiar with the writings of the war knows this word was used extensively and daily in newspapers, official US Army reports and accounts to refer to not just uniformed soldiers of the CS Army, but to any and all people of the South.  To discuss the use of this term in this article is a coy trick to insert an agenda, intended to disparage, vice simply communicate good Wiki information about this topic.  ""Guerilla"" was so commonly used as a term in this war, that it cannot be said, at all, that this term applied to, or was used more commonly for any one unit or group in the war, than any other.  If editors continue to keep this slant and bias in the article, and contiue deleting other fair contributions which are neutral, then my comment here serves as a marker to future editors of the proof of the problem in this page, and the particular set of self-chosen watch-guards who intend to keep it here, while pretending they are not the root cause of the problem."

Three comments about NPOV
The second paragraph in this article links to 5 specific and very negative reviews.  However, no positive reviews are provided.  Instead, readers are provided to the wiki entries for religious right, conservative and creationist.  Since Rotten Tomatoes was used as a primary source for ratings, could this sentence be updated to include at least one link to a positive film critic review?  As mentioned in Wikipedia:NPOV, even minority viewpoints cannot be completed ignored (and in this case, minority viewpoint should not be applied since the minority viewpoint is the thesis of the film).  
There seems to be a large discrepancy between film critic/scientific community reception of this film and popular opinion (user reviews) of this film.  Popular opinion votes on Internet websites are not considered a reliable source, but in this case, since Rotten Tomatoes was already used as a primary source for this portion of the article, could this section be updated to include a reference to popular reception to this film, with a link to the Rotten Tomatoes User Reviews? (368 reviews, 184 positive, 50% rating at the time of this edit).  Google user reviews for this film (an aggregate, largely from epinions.com) show a similar 2.6/5 or 52% positive rating. 
Why is this film being treated so much differently than Fahrenheit 9/11.  In this entry, there is no reference to film critic opinion or popular opinion of the film even though the reception was [nearly as extreme] (except positive, not negative - 85% at Rotten Tomatoes)   11:25, 5

We have a big vandalism problem 

As someone who doesn't like IE, I would normally encourage wrecking anything IE-related. But this is Wikipedia. Wikipedia is not designed to endorse anything, it is simply designed to inform about it. Why people are vandalizing the IE page is beyond me, but it's becoming a major problem. The page was recently unlocked for 3 hours, and it got raped. I think some better anti-vandalism features need to be added. It seems as if someone has a personal vendetta against IE and is encouraging other people to join them. And look at the history of the IE article - it's a page stretching flooded nightmare.

Scholary Comment sounds like a red herring to me. It is fringe theory whether or not a couple of agenda promoting scholars have tried to draw a link. Slaves were disarmed-there is no question to that. States had militias for protection. Militias were used to put down a couple of slave revolts. Then some illogical thinking takes place and something like this follows: Militias are mentioned in the 2nd amendment and militias had put down slave revolts and thus the 2nd amendment is about surpressing slaves. That is an idiotic, illogical conclusion. The valid argument is suppressed people have had their right to bear arms denied. The Europeans are a suppressed people because as Article XVII of the Commonwealth of Mass. states:""The people have a right to keep and to bear arms for the common defence. And as, in time of peace, armies are dangerous to liberty, they ought not to be maintained without the consent of the legislature; and the military power shall always be held in an exact subordination to the civil authority, and be governed by it."" Europeans do not have that right and thus are suppressed from the right to keep and bear arms. 172.56.11.104

Well thank you. I am glad that at least you can really look at existing articles, and realise a mistake has been made somewhere and apologise for it, and for that, I shall rest my case. As for the part over the assumption of good faith, perhaps I may just remind, that your introductory comment in my talk page, as well as the revert edit summary you provided are just as inflammatory and a reflection of bad faith to me in my books, and you may similarly wish to reflect a little on how you conduct your edits. To revert another purely due to the ""unnecessarily terse edit summary"" is simply unacceptable in wikipedia. If you have an issue with my comment, talk it out in the relevant talk page (and I would prefer it to be either in the article's talk page itself or in a more centralised location. This is not some kind of a you vs I issue alone. Others should know what happens in the background too. This is a community, remember?), not revert out of emotional displeasure or just to make a point. That you are ""suspicious"" of my edits based on past experience in other articles does not vindicate your current action. It speaks of nothing but very bad faith, so you may perhaps do good cleaning up your backyard first before telling others what to do (reminds me very much of global politics for some reason. D).

My comments are unbelievably inflammatory? Well I am sorry, but I do happen to be someone who usually speaks my mind, and I dont mince my words. You will have to get used to my bluntness, I suppose, as much as I have to get used to your behavior as well.

The last I checked, you created the three articles for alliancesm, with NA at the top for each of them. Now please explain to me in what way is NA the home continent for each airline alliance? CO, for your information, was created by me way back on 10 December 2004, and it started off with an alphabetical listing, and it has remained that way until 8 February 2006 when you unilaterally came along and changed the other, callig it ""standardization"". No one said anything about it after this change? Well I did, and almost immediately. I dont see any avidence of the continent order being switched back and forth at any time of its edit history, and I certainly do not see anyone commenting on the pre-existing alphabetical listing for a good 14 months straight even when NA is CO's home continent.

So now that we know just what exactly is being ""standardised"" here, are you going to apply them to the three articles you created? "

 adding information concerning online copies of journal papers (lots of journals publish at least a part of their papers online for free - the system should inform the user that at this and that url there is probably a online copy). 
 more or less automatic updating of the db according to the growing use of ref templates in WP articles
 extending this to multiple Wikis, e.g. German, French etc. (need multilanguage support, but also separate wikilinks according to language etc.)
 extending this to other areas, Physics, Computer Sciences etc.
 user management, which will become necessary when the DB gets the attention of vandals etc.

Hello. Firstly, I would like to apologize for my rude message to you. It's been a rough couple of days for myself and I have been a little too emotional and quick to anger. It doesn't reflect positively on myself and was unfair to you when you were making perfectly legitimate questions and edits. I apologize for my message to you. It wasn't done in a rational state of mind.

Secondly, it has been announced (I have actually had the priviledge of talking with a teacher at NHS who informed me of the move) that NHS will be the region's main immersion school. All Canadian students are obviously expected to have an education in French (at least up to Grade 9). However, this is what I believe to be the Immersion Program. It will only be for a select few students as the great majority will obviously continue to learn in English, but they are moving it from Aurora High.

Hopefully that helps!

He is as civil as a hedge and will skin your face
A boor
Never knows his place
As
How can a sheperd tell a good thing from a bad one?
An uncouth man is like wood unplaned,
You suddenly find
He raps out something at you like a whack
Saying:
Don't think of what I was, better look at what I am.
And
Don't look at the coat, see what's under it,
And don't scurb every pig you see or you won't long be clean yourself 
But 
Beware of a gipsy turned a Turk or of a boor turned a Greek
Beware of God's wrath, of a king's ire and a boor's squeal.

If you study the ancestry of Gloria Arroyo as recorded in the baptismal certificates in Arayat,Pampanga, their claim to Lakan Dula of Tondo lineage is through a girl with Reyes surname who married somebody with a surname Lacandola. Here is the list the children of Lakan Dula: Batang Dula, Martin Lakan Dula, Magat Salamat, Dionisio Capulong, Felipe Salonga, Luis Salugmoc and Maria Poloin. There is no one with a surname Reyes nor Lacandola. Maria Poloin married a guy with surname Talabos from where Jose Rizal came from. So, where is the link of Gloria Arroyo to Lakan Dula of Tondo? These facts are relevant to this article and must be considered by those who did not boycott this article, and by the Wikipedia itself because it might effect the credibility of the Wikipedia in the Philippines.

Water is densest at 4 degrees Celsius, but it?s not that much denser than water at other temperatures. Exploiting tiny differences in the density of water of different temperatures would be a very inefficient way of producing power. 
The only ways I know of that produce significant amounts of power from cold water are hydroelectric power (dams), tidal power, wave power, and power from ocean currents (analogous to wind power). Each of these involves falling water or water that is moving somewhat rapidly.

Flora: Yes...but I think I can find a way to duplicate the crown...somehow...but I would need the crown first.  How should we do so?
It's okay - I don't think it's a silly question at all.  I didn't know at first myself.  Well, first of all, you have to be a Christian and then wait.  The Holy Spirit will come when HE thinks you're ready.  You can pray, too, but it may not be a good idea to ask for the Holy Spirit so fast if you're not ready because if you somehow grieve the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit leaves, the Holy Spirit will never return (unless by a miracle) and you won't be able to go to heaven.  But if you're a child, living under our parents, you can go to heaven (as long as we aren't doing anything really evil, such as murder), but your parents, who have to be true Christians with the Holy Spirit, would have to be praying to God for you to go to heaven.  So if you want the Holy Spirit, all you have to do is try your best to be a Christian and wait.  But sometimes when I pray to God, I ask HIM, ""Please give me the Holy Spirit when I'm ready.""  I'm not sure exactly how you'll know when you have the Holy Spirit, but my mommy says that you'll find comfort with God and being more Christian.  So it wouldn't be a sudden sensation or feeling.  It would be being more Christian.  "

Hey!

This is a controversial subject and Wikipedia ought not to be used for POV or Promotional purposes to promote ANY political party. Prashant Bhushan (the AAP's co-founder) intervened in the BJP's Writ Petition filed through their councillor Nand Kishore Garg where this ""demand"" for CAG audit of discoms was made. The case was decided in 2011, the Court rejected the demand for CAG audit, nobody appealed this decision and it is final and binding. From Oct 2012 onwards when the AAP went political they made a series of defamatory statements about electricity sector which have all now been withdrawn from AAP's website. Many of these  old news reports refer to those AAP withdrawn statements, should they reenter Wikipedia through the backdoor of outdated sources ?  To answer your point - the AAP today (2013) is supporting BJP's demand, it is not AAP's demand for CAG audit. Both those sources say BJP and AAP are asking for CAG audit  "

Hello everyone!
I believe that what is described now in the article as the accepted convention about right- and left-handed polarization in physics is incorrect.

I read the discussion and I think that Srleffler's surmise (03 Jan 2010) about the physics convention is correct (i.e. point thumb in direction of propagation). According to RP Feynman's lectures (Vol. 1, ch.33-1) this is the convention used in physics. There might be different conventions in optics.

The 10.2% unemployment figure is the highest in 26 years. Throughout his entire first year in office, Obama has seen unemployment figures higher than they ever were under Bush. His economic stimulus plan has done absolutely nothing to control the rising unemployment, and he is seen as ineffective.

Image source problem with Image:Dark Taranis.jpg

Thanks for uploading Image:Dark Taranis.jpg. I noticed that the file's description page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the copyright status is unclear. If you did not create this file yourself, you will need to specify the owner of the copyright. If you obtained it from a website, then a link to the website from which it was taken, together with a restatement of that website's terms of use of its content, is usually sufficient information. However, if the copyright holder is different from the website's publisher, their copyright should also be acknowledged.

As well as adding the source, please add a proper copyright licensing tag if the file doesn't have one already. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the  tag can be used to release it under the GFDL. If you believe the media meets the criteria at Wikipedia:Non-free content, use a tag such as  or one of the other tags listed at Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair use. See Wikipedia:Image copyright tags for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.

If you have uploaded other files, consider checking that you have specified their source and tagged them, too. You can find a list of files you have uploaded by following this link. Unsourced and untagged images may be deleted one week after they have been tagged, as described on criteria for speedy deletion. If the image is copyrighted under a non-free license (per Wikipedia:Fair use) then the image will be deleted 48 hours after .

Template:Calcio Eintracht on it.wiki

Hi Lemmy! There's nothing personal against that eagle, I simply reverted that template because of a decision taken by some users (and I am one of them) who are trying to ""simplify"" the little flags to improve their graphic appearence. So, it's not a matter of copyrights, we just think that eagle appears not so clear at a 20px widht. We have lately modified a number of template for the same reason, or because the ""flags"" were judget not appropriate for the shades of the colours, for the complicated drawings there were on them, or simply for the history and the traditions of the club.

I know you're not the owner. I wrote you because you apparently have a passion for editing tennis articles and are heavily involved in it. I'm asking you to take my comments and use them in whatever way you need to so that the sentence will be changed. Thanks for showing me the previous version of that sentence. Very interesting. It was MUCH better the original way, although, as I said, it needs to be supported by cited sources. So when you say it's ""extreme,"" that's an understatement. Of course it's extreme. It violates Wikipedia standards because (a) it's purely subjective, and (b) it's not sourced. And what maked it worse is that it is the opening sentence of the article! Unless there are citations to multiple, credible polls of people in the world who rank him as #1, the GOAT statement needs to changed.  Just change it. Any editor who thinks the GOAT statement is acceptable doesn't understand Wikipedia's standards. There's no administrator in the world who would allow the current phrasing to stand. By the way, you can also add Bjorn Borg (and Martina Navratilova) to the list.

Dude, don't tell me what I am finding and not finding in the dictionary, when what you are saying is contradicted by the direct and immediate evidence of my own eyes.  Root ? ? ? (from which words meaning ""black"" in the sense of an abstract color are derived) is defined on page 513 of the dictionary, while root ? ? ? (whose historically-changing range of meanings I have adequately explained in past comments on this talk page above) is defined on pages 445-446 of the book.  These entries are over 50 pages apart in the dictionary.

I'm perfectly happy to add a formal reference to the Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic in this article, but the process is not facilitated by you telling me things which I know are factually false.

And I was the one who told you several times above the information about the three-fold distinction of the early Arabs between nubah ??????, ?aba? ?????, and zanj ???.  Usually, the inhabitants of nubah and ?aba?were not called Zanjis by Arabs (though occasionally they were), but when other areas of Africa (beyond the northeast Nile and coastal areas) later came into the gographical horizon of the Arabs, the inhabitants of those areas were often called Zanjis or Zun?j.

Antiochus III 

The prophecy in Daniel about Antiochus is an example of vaticum ex eventu.  Daniel is known, in the form we have it, to have been written pseudepigraphically in the 2nd century BC (the Aramaic middle chapters may be a century or so earlier) during Antiochus' persecution of the Jews 1, 2, 3 (also see Encarta, Albertz 1988, Dever 2001, the Jerusalem Bible's introduction, probably any introductory textbook to biblical studies); I took out the reference to the prophecy because 1) saying there is a mysterious prophecy that some believe refers to Antiochus is misleading; the prophecy does refer to him, because it was written during his reign retroactively, and 2) stating this in the article will generate an edit war with evangelicals, which is bad for the quality of the article.  Therefore, since it is a peripheral detail, I believe it is best left out of the article; it is dealt with in the Book of Daniel article, which can be linked to the article on Antiochus.

Gender equality is one of this project's central concepts. It was AWOL.
(reposted from Portal_talk:Feminism)

Essentially, variations on Gender equality had been hijacked six or so months ago by redirects to both Zygarchy and Equalism, and had actually begun to affect the conversation across the internet. 

This is bad news, as these terms have nothing behind them but ill-defined assertions. I've rarely been embarrassed for Wikipedia, but this is one of those moments where the site's power was left in the hands of POV/OR mischief-makers.

""Zygarchy"" is a made-up word that would never meet the WP:NEO standard if anyone had caught it. It has never meant ""rule of two genders"" before someone asserted it on Wikipedia. There are a couple hundred blogs out there crowing about the ""new word they'd learned"" while learning less than zero about notable, verifiable internationally-established gender policy. (Somewhat ominously, ""zygarchy"" is an obscure but genuine term for an ancient military formation involving two chariots. I think the chariots were used to run infantry over... or to cut them down with a chain between them...)

""Equalism"" has been used by notable sources and scholars but never consistently. There was some effort to use it to refer to communism in the fifties, anarchism at various points, and some among the Facebook crowd seem to like it better than ""feminism""; one news citation in Sweden counts it as a subset of feminism. That is to say, it's a semantic game: There is no ""-ism"" there, just a desire for one, a moving target without a developed philosophy behind it. I've redirected it to a far more notable article, Egalitarianism.

Nearly every instance of a wikilink to Gender equality had been piped to Equalism. That's what last night was all about for me: finding and removing the plumbing from this phantasm.

I've reestablished the Gender equality article with cites to the UN and an external link to the World Bank. I've added it to the various gender studies and feminism templates. This is one of this project's central concepts, and we really have to watch these pages. Cheers,  ? "

Incorrect Abbreviations Vandalism Warning 

 Bender176, kindly do not delete my message without first replying or updating the Abbreviations page. ***

Bender176, I am on a shared IP address. This is the first time I've edited any Wikipedia page. I am referring to the Abbreviations page (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbreviation#United_States). The section regarding Dr. Gale Stephens and Lana Verkuil is obviously vandalism itself. I removed it and restored the original section to what it had been pre-vandalism. Please either advise me why you marked my action as vandalism, or restore the page to its pre-vandalism form. Thank you.

PS - I probably should add that I am not the above individual you have been attempting to prevent from vandalizing Wikipedia. This IP is at a college, so there are many students, faculty, etc all under the same IP address.

 Chinese Checkers = race game ? 

The article seems to put forth a mighty definition (what is ""not"" a race game, etc.).  But it isn't that clear cut, unless one piles on exceptions.  For example, Chinese Checkers is a race without captures, the first to get one's piece somewhere.  But there is no ""track"" w/ associated ""finish line"", instead a ""home"" (designated destination).  Ditto Halma and Conspirateurs.  The race game definition in this article should allow one to be able to determine if ""race"" catagory includes them.  (Does it?)   "

" Hi, thanks for your comments on the other page. The issue there is not so much my new article but commercial interests, as some folks make good money with ""theology of the body"" books, workshops etc., which is admirable,(maybe we should do this with mariology -:))) but should not impede Wiki articles. I have not the slightest doubt on the poutcome of this one.  I think the topic to be of great interest in our context too, as I see the dogma of the assumption more and more as the greatest triumph and, next to the resurrection and ascencion of Christ, best guarantee for our own final destination. I am working on similar pages on theology. Do you want to participate? Yes, John's page is wonderful. It confirms my intention of integration to the Church fathers (Thomas Aquinas 44 000) and the Popes, but only when applicable.  Yes you are right, we should be grateful for what we were able to achieve in the month of May with HER grace. And now, its turkey against Germany. The three time Champions Germans have a better team, but the Turks played two wonderfully emotional games, giving everything, winning  with limited capacities, truly amazing.   "

 Main article links 

The reason it's a good idea to put main article links at the top of each section is that it encourages editors to expand the pages there. This is good format, per WP:STYLE. For each article there is one. Not all of them are stubs, but some of them are, and they need to be improved. If you delete the links here, those pages become orphaned. Each article is worthy of a Wikipedia page in its own right, just like the US Bill of Rights page.  "
